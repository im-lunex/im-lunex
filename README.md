Hi! Im Lunex

A Rust dev masters lifetimes, traits, and borrow rules for safe async code, chats zero-cost abstractions on Discord/Reddit evenings, devours This Week in Rust and Jon Gjengset podcasts weekends, and tweaks Zed editor for efficiencyâ€”all in steady, line-by-line learning.

current_obsession = "rust"
