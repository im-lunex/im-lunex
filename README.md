Hi, im Lunex!

A dedicated Rust developer, currently expanding into Go and deepening my expertise in problem-solving. Currently exploring production-level codebases to build practical experience and optimize my development workflow. I prefer streamlined environments that deliver exceptional performance with simplicity and precision

```
status = "learning"
current_obsession = "go"
dev_env = "arch + zed + alacritty"
```
