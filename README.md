Hi! Im Lunex

Coffee goes cold while diving deep in dotfiles again. Another night tweaking window manager configs, another morning discovering something new about C++. 

There's beauty in minimal setups and elegant code.

```
status = "always_learning"
current_obsession = "c++"
dev_env = "arch"
```
