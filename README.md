Hi! Im Lunex

Coffee goes cold while diving deep in dotfiles again. Another night tweaking window manager configs, another morning discovering something new about Rust. 

There's beauty in minimal setups and elegant code.

```
status = "always_learning"
current_obsession = "C++"
dev_env = "Arch"
```
